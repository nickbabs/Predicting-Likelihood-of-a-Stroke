Nearly 795,000 people in the United States experience a stroke yearly. 
From this group of people, 610,000 of these are first time occurances. 
This project aims to prove if there are any predictors that a stroke may occur in a person.


To accomplish this task, we will be using a dataset collected from Kaggle 
called Stroke Prediction Dataset. This dataset includes over 
5,000 rows of data and twelve relevant columns of information per person: 
age, gender, hypertension, BMI, marital status, smoker, and other descriptors. 
People in this dataset are diverse, spanning different ages, weights, lifestyle.


We plan to do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze each of the characteristics 
against whether or not a person had a stroke to determine any outstanding relationships. 
Once, we determine these correlations we will do a deeper dive into that specific data 
using machine learning prediction models (Logistic Regression & K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)).


The project is applicable for anyone who's interested in analyzing their own health, 
health insurance companies to develop rates based off of a person's forecasted medical 
future, and life insurance companies.
